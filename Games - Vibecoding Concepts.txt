Friction-Free UX Principles
Minimizing Cognitive Load
✅ Binary choice only - swipe right or left, no complex decisions
✅ Immediate feedback - no waiting to learn if you're right
✅ Progressive disclosure - hints available but not required
✅ Clear visual hierarchy - card is focal point, actions are secondary
✅ Familiar gesture - swiping is intuitive for mobile users
Encouraging Daily Habit
✅ Streak tracking - visible motivation to return
✅ Countdown timer - creates anticipation for next game
✅ 5-minute session - respects user time, low commitment
✅ Social sharing - FOMO and community engagement
✅ Fresh content daily - Wikipedia's featured article ensures variety
Supporting Learning & Exploration
✅ Contextual reveals - show where links appear after correct guesses
✅ Hint system - scaffolding for different knowledge levels
✅ Post-game exploration - extends engagement beyond game
✅ Pull quotes - surfacing interesting content from featured article
✅ Article cards - low-friction way to discover new topics
Reducing Drop-off Points
✅ No lives/penalties - can't "lose" the game, reduces frustration
✅ Skip tutorials - learn by doing with contextual hints
✅ Unlimited shuffles - control over card order reduces anxiety
✅ Free hints - encourages use without score penalty
✅ Auto-save progress - implicit, no manual saving needed

Technical Considerations for Prototype
Data Requirements
* Daily featured article API (Wikipedia)
* 10 article cards per game:
   * ~5-7 actually linked in featured article
   * ~3-5 plausible but not linked
* Article metadata: title, description, thumbnail
* Hyperlink positions within featured article text
State Management
* Current card index (1-10)
* Answers array (correct/incorrect)
* Hints used counter
* Shuffle count (for analytics, not shown)
* Streak data (localStorage for web prototype)
* Last played date
Performance Goals
* Card swipe animation: <100ms response time
* Feedback animation: complete within 500ms
* Article card loading: <200ms for smooth browsing
________________


Success Metrics
Engagement
* Daily Active Users (DAU)
* Streak retention (% users with 3+, 7+, 30+ day streaks)
* Average session duration
* Completion rate (% who finish all 10 cards)
Learning & Exploration
* Hints used per game (average)
* "Read Lead" usage rate
* Post-game article clicks
* Time spent on exploration page
Social
* Share rate (% of completed games shared)
* Viral coefficient (new users from shares)
Friction Points to Monitor
* Drop-off by card number (where do users abandon?)
* Error patterns (are certain cards confusing?)
* Hint usage patterns (which cards need hints most?)
* Time to first swipe (is onboarding clear enough?)
________________


Future Enhancements (Post-Prototype)
Considered for Android Native App
* Push notifications for daily game reminders
* Achievements system (streak milestones, perfect games)
* Leaderboards (friends or global)
* Difficulty modes (easy/hard based on article obscurity)
* Multiplayer (compete with friends on same featured article)
* Archive mode (play previous days' games)
* Accessibility (screen reader support, high contrast mode)
________________


Open Questions for User Testing
1. Is 10 cards the right number, or should we test 5/15?
2. Should wrong answers show the correct answer immediately or at end?
3. Do users want to see their accuracy % in addition to raw score?
4. Should shuffle have a subtle animation to indicate deck changed?
5. Is the exploration page too much, or does it successfully extend engagement?
6. Do users understand the game without explicit tutorial?
7. Should streak be more prominent (e.g., lose streak notification if miss a day)?

Typography
* Clear hierarchy: Large card titles, smaller descriptions
* Readable sizes: Minimum 16px for body text on mobile
* Accessible contrast: WCAG AA compliant
Animations
* Swipe: Card follows finger with subtle rotation
* Feedback: Micro-interactions (bounce for correct, shake for wrong)
* Transitions: Smooth 300ms easing between states
* Shuffle: Cards cascade/fan animation
